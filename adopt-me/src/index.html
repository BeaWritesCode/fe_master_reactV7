  <div id="root">not rendered. The tutorial specifies this div to have "not rendered" as
    the only content to make the point that React will replace anything in here & if you see "not rendered"
    then something has gone wrong. I would ordinarily have some kind of non-JS content in here instead
    (and I feel uncomfortable committing without it!)
