      not rendered. The tutorial specifies this div to have "not rendered" as
      the only content to make the point that React will replace anything in
      here & if you see "not rendered" then something has gone wrong. I would
      ordinarily have some kind of non-JS content in here instead (and I feel
      uncomfortable committing without it!)
